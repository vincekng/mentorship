# Mentorship

Create a free-form tool for both mentors and mentees to use during mentorship sessions. 

Why:

As a mentor, I wanted to keep track of To Do items for both parties. We can keep track of progress.

Key features:

A form to store information like user info for both mentors and mentees. 
Create different cards to use as tasks during sessions. 
Make API requests using Trello https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/

# Landing Page and Signup/Login Page

The landing page contains a sign up/login form for the end user to complete.

# Mentorship Page

The mentorship page will either:

Display current/future cards for an existing user.
Empty page to create new cards for new users.

# Edit Page

Both mentor/mentee can edit the card

# Account Page
Display the end user's name and email address.

# Implementation
Mentorship will be implemented using React and Next.js for the user interface. The application will use TailwindCSS for design. I am still debating which user authentication to user for beginners.
